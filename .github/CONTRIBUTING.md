# Contributing to *collapse*

- Please file an issue or feature request ideally using the [templates](https://github.com/SebKrantz/collapse/tree/development/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE).
- For broader proposals start a [discussion](https://github.com/SebKrantz/collapse/discussions).
- To contribute directly, fork the entire repo (including the 'development' branch), make your changes in the 'development' branch, and send a PR to the 'development' branch.
- I'll mention contributors in the `DESCRIPTION` file as `"ctb"` if the contribution is substantial, i.e., doesn't amount to a bug fix but new functionality.
