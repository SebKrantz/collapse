Description: A C/C++ based package for advanced data transformation and 
    statistical computing in R that is extremely fast, class-agnostic,
    and programmer friendly through a flexible and parsimonious syntax.
    It is well integrated with base R, 'dplyr' / (grouped) 'tibble', 
    'data.table', 'sf', 'plm' (panel-series and data frames), and 
    non-destructively handles other matrix or data frame based classes (like 
    'ts', 'xts' / 'zoo', 'tsibble', ...)
    --- Key Features: ---
    (1) Advanced statistical programming: A full set of fast statistical functions 
        supporting grouped and weighted computations on vectors, matrices and 
        data frames. Fast and programmable grouping, ordering, unique values/rows, 
        factor generation and interactions. Fast and flexible functions for data 
        manipulation, data object conversions, and memory efficient R programming.
    (2) Advanced aggregation: Fast and easy multi-data-type, multi-function, weighted 
        and parallelized data aggregation.
    (3) Advanced transformations: Fast row/column arithmetic, (grouped) replacing 
        and sweeping out of statistics (by reference), (grouped, weighted) scaling/standardizing, 
        (higher-dimensional) between (averaging) and (quasi-)within (demeaning) transformations, 
        linear prediction, model fitting and testing exclusion restrictions.
    (4) Advanced time-computations: Fast and flexible indexed time series and panel data classes. 
        Fast (sequences of) lags/leads, and  (lagged/leaded, iterated, quasi-, log-) 
        differences and (compounded) growth rates on (irregular) time series and panels. 
        Multivariate auto-, partial- and cross-correlation functions for panel data. 
        Panel data to (ts-)array conversions.
    (5) List processing: Recursive list search, splitting, 
        extraction/subsetting, apply, and generalized row-binding / unlisting to data frame.
    (6) Advanced data exploration: Fast (grouped, weighted, panel-decomposed) 
        summary statistics and descriptive tools.
