Description: A C/C++ based package for advanced data transformation in R that is 
    extremely fast, flexible and parsimonious to code with and programmer 
    friendly. It is well integrated with 'dplyr', 'plm' and 'data.table'.
    --- Key Features: ---
    (1) Advanced data programming: A full set of fast statistical functions 
        supporting grouped and/or weighted computations on vectors, matrices 
        and data.frames. Fast (ordered) and reusable grouping, quick data 
        conversions, and quick select, replace or add data.frame columns.
    (2) Advanced aggregation: Fast and easy multi-data-type, multi-function, 
        weighted, parallelized and fully customized data aggregation.
    (3) Advanced transformations: Fast (grouped, weighted) replacing and 
        sweeping out of statistics, scaling, centering, higher-dimensional 
        centering, complex linear prediction and partialling-out.
    (4) Advanced time-computations: Fast (sequences of) lags / leads, and 
        (lagged / leaded, iterated) differences and growth rates on (unordered) 
        time-series and panel data. Multivariate auto, partial and cross-
        correlation functions for panel data. Panel data to (ts-)array conversions.
    (5) List processing: (Recursive) list search / identification, extraction / 
        subsetting, data-apply, and row-binding / unlisting in 2D.
    (6) Advanced data exploration: Fast (grouped, weighted, panel-decomposed) 
        summary statistics for complex multilevel / panel data.
