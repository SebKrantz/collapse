<!--
*collapse* is a C/C++ based package for data transformation and statistical computing in R. It's aims are:

1. To facilitate complex data transformation, exploration and computing tasks in R.
2. To help make R code fast, flexible, parsimonious and programmer friendly.
-->
This vignette focuses on the integration of *collapse* and the popular *plm* ('Linear Models for Panel Data') package by Yves Croissant, Giovanni Millo and Kevin Tappe. It will demonstrate the utility of the *pseries* and *pdata.frame* classes introduced in *plm* together with the corresponding methods for fast *collapse* functions (implemented in C or C++), to extend and facilitate extremely fast computations on panel-vectors and panel data frames (20-100 times faster than native *plm*). The *collapse* package should enable R programmers to - with very little effort - write high-performance code in the domain of panel data exploration and panel data econometrics.

<!-- The computations considered are between and within transformations (grouped averaging and centering), higher-dimensional between and within transformations (i.e. averaging and centering over multiple groups), standardizing (i.e. scaling and centering), weighted versions of all of the above, sequences of panel- lags / leads and lagged / leaded and iterated differences and growth rates / log-differences, panel- auto-, partial-auto and cross-correlation functions, panel data to (ts-) matrix / array conversions, and summary statistics for panel data. Not really covered in this vignette is the whole suite of *Fast Statistical Functions* in the *collapse* package, which may of course also be used for grouped and weighted operations on panel data, but currently do not have methods for *plm* classes.  -->

***
**Notes:**

- To learn more about *collapse*, see the 'Introduction to *collapse*' vignette or the built-in structured documentation available under `help("collapse-documentation")` after installing the package. In addition `help("collapse-package")` provides a compact set of examples for quick-start.

- Documentation and vignettes can also be viewed [online](<https://fastverse.github.io/collapse/>).

***

The vignette is structured as follows:

* **Part 1** introduces *collapse*'s fast functions and associated *transformation operators* to compute various transformations on panel data, and delivers some benchmarks.

* **Part 2** uses these functions to explore panel data a bit and introduce additional functions for summary statistics, panel-autocorrelations and testing fixed effects.

* **Part 3** finally provides an example programming application by coding a slightly extended and very efficient Hausman and Taylor (1981) estimator.

For this vignette we will use a dataset (`wlddev`) supplied with *collapse* containing a panel of 5 key development indicators taken from the World Bank Development Indicators Database:


```r
library(collapse)

head(wlddev)

```

## Part 1: Fast Transformation of Panel Data

First let us convert this data to a *plm* panel data.frame (class *pdata.frame*):


```r
library(plm)

# This creates a panel data frame
pwlddev <- pdata.frame(wlddev, index = c("iso3c", "year"))

str(pwlddev, give.attr = FALSE)
# Classes 'pdata.frame' and 'data.frame':	13176 obs. of  13 variables:
#  $ country: 'pseries' Named chr  "Aruba" "Aruba" "Aruba" "Aruba" ...
#  $ iso3c  : Factor w/ 216 levels "ABW","AFG","AGO",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
#  $ date   : pseries, format: "1961-01-01" "1962-01-01" "1963-01-01" ...
#  $ year   : Factor w/ 61 levels "1960","1961",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
#  $ decade : 'pseries' Named int  1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 ...
#  $ region : Factor w/ 7 levels "East Asia & Pacific",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...
#  $ income : Factor w/ 4 levels "High income",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
#  $ OECD   : 'pseries' Named logi  FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ...
#  $ PCGDP  : 'pseries' Named num  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
#  $ LIFEEX : 'pseries' Named num  65.7 66.1 66.4 66.8 67.1 ...
#  $ GINI   : 'pseries' Named num  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
#  $ ODA    : 'pseries' Named num  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
#  $ POP    : 'pseries' Named num  54211 55438 56225 56695 57032 ...

# A pdata.frame has an index attribute attached [retrieved using index(pwlddev) or attr(pwlddev, "index")]
str(index(pwlddev))
# Classes 'pindex' and 'data.frame':	13176 obs. of  2 variables:
#  $ iso3c: Factor w/ 216 levels "ABW","AFG","AGO",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
#  $ year : Factor w/ 61 levels "1960","1961",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...

# This shows the individual and time dimensions
pdim(pwlddev)
# Balanced Panel: n = 216, T = 61, N = 13176
```
<!-- # This shows which variables vary across which dimensions -->
<!-- pvar(pwlddev) -->

A `plm::pdata.frame` is a data.frame with panel identifiers attached as a list of factors in an *index* attribute (non-factor index variables are converted to factor). Each column in that data.frame is a Panel Series (`plm::pseries`), which also has the panel identifiers attached:


```r
# Panel Series of GDP per Capita and Life-Expectancy at Birth
PCGDP <- pwlddev$PCGDP
LIFEEX <- pwlddev$LIFEEX
str(LIFEEX)
#  'pseries' Named num [1:13176] 65.7 66.1 66.4 66.8 67.1 ...
#  - attr(*, "names")= chr [1:13176] "ABW-1960" "ABW-1961" "ABW-1962" "ABW-1963" ...
#  - attr(*, "index")=Classes 'pindex' and 'data.frame':	13176 obs. of  2 variables:
#   ..$ iso3c: Factor w/ 216 levels "ABW","AFG","AGO",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
#   ..$ year : Factor w/ 61 levels "1960","1961",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
```

Now that we have explored the basic data structures provided in the *plm* package, let's compute some transformations on them:

### 1.1 Between and Within Transformations

The functions `fbetween` and `fbetween` can be used to compute efficient between and within transformations on panel vectors and panel data.frames:


```r
# Between-Transformations
head(fbetween(LIFEEX))                        # Between individual (default)
# ABW-1960 ABW-1961 ABW-1962 ABW-1963 ABW-1964 ABW-1965 
# 72.40653 72.40653 72.40653 72.40653 72.40653 72.40653

head(fbetween(LIFEEX, effect = "year"))       # Between time
# ABW-1960 ABW-1961 ABW-1962 ABW-1963 ABW-1964 ABW-1965 
# 53.91206 54.47441 54.85718 55.20272 55.66802 56.12963

# Within-Transformations
head(fwithin(LIFEEX))                         # Within individuals (default)
#  ABW-1960  ABW-1961  ABW-1962  ABW-1963  ABW-1964  ABW-1965 
# -6.744533 -6.332533 -5.962533 -5.619533 -5.293533 -4.971533

head(fwithin(LIFEEX, effect = "year"))        # Within time
# ABW-1960 ABW-1961 ABW-1962 ABW-1963 ABW-1964 ABW-1965 
# 11.74994 11.59959 11.58682 11.58428 11.44498 11.30537
```

by default `na.rm = TRUE` thus both functions skip (preserve) missing values in the data (which is the default for all *collapse* functions). For `fbetween` the output behavior can be altered with the option `fill`: Setting `fill = TRUE` will compute the group-means on the complete cases in each group (as long as `na.rm = TRUE`), but replace all values in each group with the group mean (hence overwriting or 'filling up' missing values):


```r
# This preserves missing values in the output
head(fbetween(PCGDP), 30)
# ABW-1960 ABW-1961 ABW-1962 ABW-1963 ABW-1964 ABW-1965 ABW-1966 ABW-1967 ABW-1968 ABW-1969 ABW-1970 
#       NA       NA       NA       NA       NA       NA       NA       NA       NA       NA       NA 
# ABW-1971 ABW-1972 ABW-1973 ABW-1974 ABW-1975 ABW-1976 ABW-1977 ABW-1978 ABW-1979 ABW-1980 ABW-1981 
#       NA       NA       NA       NA       NA       NA       NA       NA       NA       NA       NA 
# ABW-1982 ABW-1983 ABW-1984 ABW-1985 ABW-1986 ABW-1987 ABW-1988 ABW-1989 
#       NA       NA       NA       NA 25413.84 25413.84 25413.84 25413.84

# This replaces all individuals with the group mean
head(fbetween(PCGDP, fill = TRUE), 30)
# ABW-1960 ABW-1961 ABW-1962 ABW-1963 ABW-1964 ABW-1965 ABW-1966 ABW-1967 ABW-1968 ABW-1969 ABW-1970 
# 25413.84 25413.84 25413.84 25413.84 25413.84 25413.84 25413.84 25413.84 25413.84 25413.84 25413.84 
# ABW-1971 ABW-1972 ABW-1973 ABW-1974 ABW-1975 ABW-1976 ABW-1977 ABW-1978 ABW-1979 ABW-1980 ABW-1981 
# 25413.84 25413.84 25413.84 25413.84 25413.84 25413.84 25413.84 25413.84 25413.84 25413.84 25413.84 
# ABW-1982 ABW-1983 ABW-1984 ABW-1985 ABW-1986 ABW-1987 ABW-1988 ABW-1989 
# 25413.84 25413.84 25413.84 25413.84 25413.84 25413.84 25413.84 25413.84
```

In `fwithin` the `mean` argument allows to set an arbitrary data mean (different from 0) after the data is centered. In grouped centering task, as sensible choice for such an added mean would be the overall mean of the data series, enabled by the option `mean = "overall.mean"`. This will add the overall mean of the series back to the data after subtracting out group means, and thus preserve the level of the data (and will only change the intercept when employed in a regression):


```r
# This performed standard grouped centering
head(fwithin(LIFEEX))
#  ABW-1960  ABW-1961  ABW-1962  ABW-1963  ABW-1964  ABW-1965 
# -6.744533 -6.332533 -5.962533 -5.619533 -5.293533 -4.971533

# This adds the overall average Life-Expectancy (across countries) to the country-demeaned series
head(fwithin(LIFEEX, mean = "overall.mean"))
# ABW-1960 ABW-1961 ABW-1962 ABW-1963 ABW-1964 ABW-1965 
# 57.55177 57.96377 58.33377 58.67677 59.00277 59.32477
```

`fbetween` and `fwithin` can also be applied to *pdata.frame*'s where they will perform these computations variable by variable:


```r
head(fbetween(num_vars(pwlddev)), 3)
#            decade PCGDP   LIFEEX GINI ODA      POP
# ABW-1960 1985.574    NA 72.40653   NA  NA 76268.63
# ABW-1961 1985.574    NA 72.40653   NA  NA 76268.63
# ABW-1962 1985.574    NA 72.40653   NA  NA 76268.63

head(fbetween(num_vars(pwlddev), fill = TRUE), 3)
#            decade    PCGDP   LIFEEX GINI      ODA      POP
# ABW-1960 1985.574 25413.84 72.40653   NA 33245000 76268.63
# ABW-1961 1985.574 25413.84 72.40653   NA 33245000 76268.63
# ABW-1962 1985.574 25413.84 72.40653   NA 33245000 76268.63

head(fwithin(num_vars(pwlddev)), 3)
#             decade PCGDP    LIFEEX GINI ODA       POP
# ABW-1960 -25.57377    NA -6.744533   NA  NA -22057.63
# ABW-1961 -25.57377    NA -6.332533   NA  NA -20830.63
# ABW-1962 -25.57377    NA -5.962533   NA  NA -20043.63

head(fwithin(num_vars(pwlddev), mean = "overall.mean"), 3)
#          decade PCGDP   LIFEEX GINI ODA      POP
# ABW-1960   1960    NA 57.55177   NA  NA 24223914
# ABW-1961   1960    NA 57.96377   NA  NA 24225141
# ABW-1962   1960    NA 58.33377   NA  NA 24225928
```

Now next to `fbetween` and `fwithin` there also exist short versions `B` and `W`, which are referred to as *transformation operators*. These are essentially wrappers around `fbetween` and `fwithin` and provide the same functionality, but are more parsimonious to employ in regression formulas and also offer additional features when applied to panel data.frames. For panel series, `B` and `W` are exact analogues to `fbetween` and `fwithin`, just under a shorter name:


```r
identical(fbetween(PCGDP), B(PCGDP))
# [1] TRUE
identical(fbetween(PCGDP, fill = TRUE), B(PCGDP, fill = TRUE))
# [1] TRUE
identical(fwithin(PCGDP), W(PCGDP))
# [1] TRUE
identical(fwithin(PCGDP, mean = "overall.mean"), W(PCGDP, mean = "overall.mean"))
# [1] TRUE
```

When applied to panel data.frames, `B` and `W` offer some additional utility by (a) allowing you to select columns to transform using the `cols` argument (default is `cols = is.numeric`, so by default all numeric columns will be selected for transformation), (b) allowing you to add a prefix to the transformed columns with the `stub` argument (default is `stub = "B."` for `B` and `stub = "W."` for `W`) and (c) preserving the panel-id's with the `keep.ids` argument (default `keep.ids = TRUE`):


```r
head(B(pwlddev), 3)
#          iso3c year B.decade B.PCGDP B.LIFEEX B.GINI B.ODA    B.POP
# ABW-1960   ABW 1960 1985.574      NA 72.40653     NA    NA 76268.63
# ABW-1961   ABW 1961 1985.574      NA 72.40653     NA    NA 76268.63
# ABW-1962   ABW 1962 1985.574      NA 72.40653     NA    NA 76268.63

head(W(pwlddev, cols = 9:12), 3) # Here using the cols argument
#          iso3c year W.PCGDP  W.LIFEEX W.GINI W.ODA
# ABW-1960   ABW 1960      NA -6.744533     NA    NA
# ABW-1961   ABW 1961      NA -6.332533     NA    NA
# ABW-1962   ABW 1962      NA -5.962533     NA    NA
```

<!-- The main philosophy behind having transformation operators like `B` and `W` is that they are more parsimonious to use ad-hoc (i.e. to demean a variable in a regression formula), and also offer more convenient output for ad-hoc computations on data.frames, whereas the corresponding functions `fbetween` and `fwithin` are a bit simpler in terms of R-code (and thus a tiny bit faster) and also more convenient for programming since they require all inputs to be provided in terms of data.  -->

`fbetween` / `B` and `fwithin` / `W` also support weighted computations. This of course applies more to panel-survey settings, but for the sake of illustration suppose we wanted to weight our between and within transformations by the population of these countries:


```r
# This replaces values by the POP-weighted group mean and also preserves the weight variable (POP, argument keep.w = TRUE)
head(B(pwlddev, w = ~ POP), 3)
#          iso3c year   POP B.decade B.PCGDP B.LIFEEX B.GINI B.ODA
# ABW-1960   ABW 1960 54211 1988.976      NA 72.96257     NA    NA
# ABW-1961   ABW 1961 55438 1988.976      NA 72.96257     NA    NA
# ABW-1962   ABW 1962 56225 1988.976      NA 72.96257     NA    NA

# This centers values on the POP-weighted group mean
head(W(pwlddev, w = ~ POP, cols = c("PCGDP","LIFEEX","GINI")), 3)
#          iso3c year   POP W.PCGDP  W.LIFEEX W.GINI
# ABW-1960   ABW 1960 54211      NA -7.300566     NA
# ABW-1961   ABW 1961 55438      NA -6.888566     NA
# ABW-1962   ABW 1962 56225      NA -6.518566     NA

# This centers values on the POP-weighted group mean and also adds the overall POP-weighted mean of the data
head(W(pwlddev, w = ~ POP, cols = c("PCGDP","LIFEEX","GINI"), mean = "overall.mean"), 3)
#          iso3c year   POP W.PCGDP W.LIFEEX W.GINI
# ABW-1960   ABW 1960 54211      NA 58.58012     NA
# ABW-1961   ABW 1961 55438      NA 58.99212     NA
# ABW-1962   ABW 1962 56225      NA 59.36212     NA
```

As shown above, with `B` and `W` the weight column can also be passed as a formula or character string, whereas `fbetween` and `fwithin` require the all inputs to be passed directly in terms of data (i.e. `fbetween(get_vars(pwlddev, 9:11), w = pwlddev$POP)`), and the weight vector or id columns are never preserved in the output. Therefore in most applications `B` and `W` are probably more convenient for quick use, whereas `fbetween` and `fwithin` are the preferred programmers choice, also because they have a little less R-overhead which makes them a tiny bit faster.

### 1.2 Higher-Dimensional Between and Within Transformations

Analogous to `fbetween` / `B` and `fwithin` / `W`, *collapse* provides a duo of functions and operators `fhdbetween` / `HDB` and `fhdwithin` / `HDW` to efficiently average and center data on multiple groups. The credit herefore goes to Laurent Berge, the author of the *fixest* package who wrote an efficient C-implementation of the alternating-projections algorithm to perform this task. `fhdbetween` / `HDB` and `fhdwithin` / `HDW` enrich this implementation (available in the function `fixest::demean`) by providing more options regarding missing values, and also allowing continuous covariates and (full) interactions to be projected out alongside factors. The methods for *pseries* and *pdata.frame*'s are however rather simple, as they simply simultaneously center panel-vectors on various panel-identifiers in the index (which can be more than 2, the default is to center on all identifiers):


```r
# This simultaneously averages Life-Expectancy across countries and years

The architecture of `fhdbetween` / `HDB` and `fhdwithin` / `HDW` differs a bit from `fbetween` / `B` and `fwithin` / `W`. This is essentially a consequence of the underlying C++-implementation (accessed through `fixest::demean`), which was not built to accommodate missing values. `fhdbetween` / `HDB` and `fhdwithin` / `HDW` therefore both have an argument `fill = TRUE` (the default), which stipulates that missing values in the data are preserved in the output. The *collapse* default `na.rm = TRUE` again ensures that only complete cases are used for the computation:


```r
# Missing values are preserved in the output when fill = TRUE (the default)
head(HDB(PCGDP), 30)
# ABW-1960 ABW-1961 ABW-1962 ABW-1963 ABW-1964 ABW-1965 ABW-1966 ABW-1967 ABW-1968 ABW-1969 ABW-1970

In the *pdata.frame* methods there are 3 different choices how to deal with missing values. The default for the *plm* classes in `variable.wise = TRUE`, which will essentially sequentially apply `fhdbetween.pseries` and `fhdwithin.pseries` (with the default `fill = TRUE`) to all columns. This is the same behavior as in `fbetween` / `B` and `fwithin` / `W`, which also consider the column-wise complete obs:


```r
# This column-wise centers the data on countries and years
tail(HDW(pwlddev), 10)
#          HDW.decade HDW.PCGDP HDW.LIFEEX  HDW.GINI   HDW.ODA  HDW.POP

```

If `variable.wise = FALSE`, `fhdbetween` / `HDB` and `fhdwithin` / `HDW` will only consider the complete cases in the dataset, but still return a dataset of the same dimensions (as long as `fill = TRUE`), resulting in some rows all-missing:


```r
# This centers the complete cases of the data data on countries and years and keeps missing cases
tail(HDW(pwlddev, variable.wise = FALSE), 10)
#          HDW.decade HDW.PCGDP HDW.LIFEEX  HDW.GINI    HDW.ODA  HDW.POP
# ZWE-2011          0  517.6924  -4.379840 -3.839653 -176176494 -3042247

# ZWE-2020         NA        NA         NA        NA         NA       NA
```

Finally, if also `fill = FALSE`, the behavior is the same as in the *pseries* method: Missing cases are removed from the data:


```r
# This centers the complete cases of the data data on countries and years, and removes missing cases
res <- HDW(pwlddev, fill = FALSE)
tail(res, 10)
#          HDW.decade   HDW.PCGDP HDW.LIFEEX   HDW.GINI    HDW.ODA    HDW.POP

```

<!-- Again it is possible to perform weighted higher-order transformations, but the weight vector is not preserved and this -->
<!-- ```{r, eval = NCRAN} -->
<!-- # This centers the complete cases of the data data on countries and years, and removes missing cases -->
<!-- HDW(pwlddev, w = pwlddev$POP, cols = 9:11, fill = FALSE, variable.wise = FALSE) -->
<!-- ``` -->

*Notes: * (1) Because of the different missing case options and associated challenges, panel-identifiers are not preserved in `HDB` and `HDW`. (2) The default `variable.wise = TRUE` and `fill = TRUE` was only set for the *pseries* and *pdata.frame* methods, to harmonize the default implementations with `fbetween` / `B` and `fwithin` / `W` for these classes. In the standard *default*, *matrix* and *data.frame* methods, the defaults are `variable.wise = FALSE` and `fill = FALSE` (i.e. missing cases are removed beforehand), which is generally more efficient.


### 1.3 Scaling and Centering

Next to the above functions for grouped centering and averaging, the function / operator pair `fscale` / `STD` can be used to efficiently standardize (i.e. scale and center) panel data along an arbitrary dimension. The architecture is identical to that of `fwithin` / `W` or `fbetween` / `B`.


```r
# This standardizes GDP per capita in each country
STD_PCGDP <- STD(PCGDP)

# Checks:
head(fmean(STD_PCGDP, index(STD_PCGDP, 1)))
#           ABW           AFG           AGO           ALB           AND           ARE 
# -1.422473e-15  2.528841e-16 -6.189493e-16 -2.275957e-16 -9.281464e-16 -6.661338e-17
head(fsd(STD_PCGDP, index(STD_PCGDP, 1)))
# ABW AFG AGO ALB AND ARE 
#   1   1   1   1   1   1

# This standardizes GDP per capita in each year
STD_PCGDP_T <- STD(PCGDP, effect = "year")

# Checks:
head(fmean(STD_PCGDP_T, index(STD_PCGDP_T, 2)))
#          1960          1961          1962          1963          1964          1965 
#  9.882205e-17  3.496021e-16  1.889741e-17 -2.185013e-16 -1.724389e-16  2.616954e-16
head(fsd(STD_PCGDP_T, index(STD_PCGDP_T, 2)))
# 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 
#    1    1    1    1    1    1
```

And similarly for *pdata.frame*'s:


```r
head(STD(pwlddev, cols = 9:12))
#          iso3c year STD.PCGDP STD.LIFEEX STD.GINI STD.ODA
# ABW-1960   ABW 1960        NA  -2.372636       NA      NA
# ABW-1961   ABW 1961        NA  -2.227700       NA      NA
# ABW-1962   ABW 1962        NA  -2.097539       NA      NA
# ABW-1963   ABW 1963        NA  -1.976876       NA      NA
# ABW-1964   ABW 1964        NA  -1.862193       NA      NA
# ABW-1965   ABW 1965        NA  -1.748918       NA      NA

head(STD(pwlddev, cols = 9:12, effect = "year"))
#          iso3c year STD.PCGDP STD.LIFEEX STD.GINI STD.ODA
# ABW-1960   ABW 1960        NA  0.9609854       NA      NA
# ABW-1961   ABW 1961        NA  0.9485730       NA      NA
# ABW-1962   ABW 1962        NA  0.9585105       NA      NA
# ABW-1963   ABW 1963        NA  0.9669638       NA      NA
# ABW-1964   ABW 1964        NA  0.9579477       NA      NA
# ABW-1965   ABW 1965        NA  0.9556529       NA      NA
```

More customized scaling can be done with the help of the `mean` and `sd` arguments to `fscale` / `STD`. By default `mean = 0` and `sd = 1`, but these could be assigned any numeric values:


```r
# This will scale the data such that mean mean within each country is 5 and the standard deviation is 3
qsu(fscale(pwlddev$PCGDP, mean = 5, sd = 3))
#              N/T  Mean     SD      Min     Max
# Overall     9466     5  2.968  -6.1908  16.257
# Between      202     5      0        5       5
# Within   46.8614     5  2.968  -6.1908  16.257
```
Even further customization (i.e. setting means and standard deviations for each group and / or each column) can of course be achieved by calling `collapse::TRA` on the result of `fscale` to sweep out an appropriate set of means and standard deviations.

Scaling without centering can be done with the option `mean = FALSE`. This will also preserve the mean of the data overall and within each group:

```r
# Scaling without centering: Mean preserving with fscale / STD
qsu(fscale(pwlddev$PCGDP, mean = FALSE, sd = 3))
#              N/T        Mean          SD         Min         Max
# Overall     9466  12031.4627  17803.3537    247.7598   131349.27
# Between      202  12169.2793  18055.6626    253.1886  131342.669
# Within   46.8614  12031.4627       2.968  12020.2718  12042.7196

# Scaling without centering can also be done using fsd, but this does not preserve the mean
qsu(fsd(pwlddev$PCGDP, index(pwlddev, 1), TRA = "/"))
#              N/T    Mean      SD     Min      Max
# Overall     9466   4.247   3.192  0.0579   26.647
# Between      202  4.6036  3.5846  0.8207  24.8111
# Within   46.8614   4.247  0.9893  0.5167   7.9993
```

<!-- # Again, the *Fast Statistical Functions* in *collapse* do not have methods for *pseries* or *pdata.frame*'s (yet). -->

Finally a special kind of data harmonization in the first two moments can be done by setting `mean = "overall.mean"` and `sd = "within.sd"` in a grouped scaling task. This will harmonize the data across groups such that the mean of each group is equal to the overall data mean and the standard deviation equal to the within standard deviation (= the standard deviation calculated on the group-centered series):


```r
fmean(pwlddev$PCGDP)  # Overall mean
# [1] 12048.78
fsd(W(pwlddev$PCGDP)) # Within sd
# [1] 6723.681

# Scaling and centerin such that the mean of each country is the overall mean, and the sd of each country is the within sd
qsu(fscale(pwlddev$PCGDP, mean = "overall.mean", sd = "within.sd"))
#              N/T       Mean         SD          Min         Max
# Overall     9466  12048.778  6651.9052  -13032.4333  37278.2175
# Between      202  12048.778          0    12048.778   12048.778
# Within   46.8614  12048.778  6651.9052  -13032.4333  37278.2175
```

All of this seamlessly generalizes to weighted scaling an centering, using the `w` argument to add a weight vector.

### 1.4 Panel Lags / Leads, Differences and Growth Rates
<!-- A proper *and* fast implementation of panel- lags, differences and growth rates has been missing in R so far. -->

With `flag` / `L` / `F`, `fdiff` / `D` and `fgrowth` / `G`, *collapse* provides a fast and comprehensive C++ based solution to the computation of (sequences of) lags / leads and (sequences of) lagged / leaded and suitably iterated (quasi-, log-) differences and growth rates on panel data. The *pseries* and *pdata.frame* methods to these functions and associated *transformation operators* use the panel-identifiers in the 'index' attached to these objects (where the last variable in the 'index' is taken as the time-variable and the variables before that are taken as individual identifiers) to perform fast fully-identified time-dependent operations on panel data, without the need of sorting the data.

<!-- With 'proper' I mean an implementation that does not require panel-vectors to be sorted (amounting i.e. to a grouped-lag on sorted data), but that takes into account both individual an time-identifiers in the computation. `plm::lag` and `dplyr::lag` (with the `order_by` argument) provide proper implementations but rely on base-R (split-apply-combine logic) which makes them slow. `data.table::shift` allows for pretty fast grouped lags on sorted data, but without taking into account the time-identifiers (you can do something like `DT[oder(time), shift(col1), by = pid]` in *data.table* but that sorts the data and is definitely more computationally expensive than the implementation introduced here).  -->


With `flag` / `L` / `F`, it is easy to lag or lead *pseries*:


```r
# A panel-lag
head(flag(LIFEEX))
# ABW-1960 ABW-1961 ABW-1962 ABW-1963 ABW-1964 ABW-1965 
#       NA   65.662   66.074   66.444   66.787   67.113

# A panel-lead
head(flag(LIFEEX, -1))
# ABW-1960 ABW-1961 ABW-1962 ABW-1963 ABW-1964 ABW-1965 
#   66.074   66.444   66.787   67.113   67.435   67.762

# The lag and lead operators are even more parsimonious to employ:
all_identical(L(LIFEEX), flag(LIFEEX), lag(LIFEEX))
# [1] TRUE
all_identical(F(LIFEEX), flag(LIFEEX, -1), lead(LIFEEX))
# [1] TRUE
```

It is also possible to compute a sequence of lags / leads using `flag` or one of the operators:


```r
# sequence of panel- lags and leads
head(flag(LIFEEX, -1:3))
#              F1     --     L1     L2     L3

Of course the lag orders may be unevenly spaced, i.e. `L(x, -1:3*12)` would compute seasonal lags on monthly data. On *pdata.frame*'s, the effects of `flag` and `L` / `F` differ insofar that `flag` will just lag the entire dataset without preserving identifiers (although the index attribute is always preserved), whereas `L` / `F` by default (`cols = is.numeric`) select the numeric variables and add the panel-id's on the left (default `keep.ids = TRUE`):


```r
# This lags the entire data
head(flag(pwlddev))

We can also easily compute a sequence of lags / leads on a panel data.frame:

Essentially the same functionality applies to `fdiff` / `D` and `fgrowth` / `G`, with the main differences that these functions also have a `diff` argument to determine the number of iterations:


```r
# Panel-difference of Life Expectancy
head(fdiff(LIFEEX))
# ABW-1960 ABW-1961 ABW-1962 ABW-1963 ABW-1964 ABW-1965 
#       NA    0.412    0.370    0.343    0.326    0.322

# Second panel-difference
head(fdiff(LIFEEX, diff = 2))
# ABW-1960 ABW-1961 ABW-1962 ABW-1963 ABW-1964 ABW-1965 
#       NA       NA   -0.042   -0.027   -0.017   -0.004

# Panel-growth rate of Life Expectancy
head(fgrowth(LIFEEX))
#  ABW-1960  ABW-1961  ABW-1962  ABW-1963  ABW-1964  ABW-1965 
#        NA 0.6274558 0.5599782 0.5162242 0.4881189 0.4797878

# Growth rate of growth rate of Life Expectancy
head(fgrowth(LIFEEX, diff = 2))
#   ABW-1960   ABW-1961   ABW-1962   ABW-1963   ABW-1964   ABW-1965 
#         NA         NA -10.754153  -7.813521  -5.444387  -1.706782

identical(D(LIFEEX), fdiff(LIFEEX))
# [1] TRUE
identical(G(LIFEEX), fgrowth(LIFEEX))
# [1] TRUE
identical(fdiff(LIFEEX), diff(LIFEEX)) # Same as plm::diff.pseries (which does not compute iterated panel-differences)
# [1] TRUE
```

By default, growth rates are calculated in percentage terms  which is set by the default argument `scale = 100`. It is also possible to compute log-differences with `fdiff(.., log = TRUE)` or the `Dlog` operator, and growth rates in percentage terms based on log-differences using `fgrowth(.., logdiff = TRUE)`.

<!-- It is also possible to compute growth rates based on log-differences which are often used in economics for various reasons (i.e. symmetry, exponential trends on macro-series, heteroskedasticity, properties of the log etc..). In that case the formula is `(log(x) - lag(log(x))) * 100` or `log(x/lag(x)) * 100`: -->


```r
# Panel log-difference of Life Expectancy
head(Dlog(LIFEEX))
#    ABW-1960    ABW-1961    ABW-1962    ABW-1963    ABW-1964    ABW-1965

# Panel log-difference growth rate (in percentage terms) of Life Expectancy
head(G(LIFEEX, logdiff = TRUE))
#  ABW-1960  ABW-1961  ABW-1962  ABW-1963  ABW-1964  ABW-1965 
#        NA 0.6254955 0.5584162 0.5148963 0.4869315 0.4786405
```

It is also possible to compute sequences of lagged / leaded and iterated differences, log-differences and growth rates:


```r

A further possibility is to compute quasi-differences and quasi-log-differences of the form $x_t - \rho x_{t-s}$ or $log(x_t) - \rho log(x_{t-s})$. These are useful for panel-regressions suffering from serial-correlation, following Cochrane & Orcutt (1949), and can be specified with the `rho` argument to `fdiff`, `D` and `Dlog`.


```r
# Regression of GDP on Life Expectance with country and time FE
mod <- lm(PCGDP ~ LIFEEX, data = fhdwithin(fselect(pwlddev, PCGDP, LIFEEX), fill = FALSE))
mod
# 
# Call:
# lm(formula = PCGDP ~ LIFEEX, data = fhdwithin(fselect(pwlddev, 
#     PCGDP, LIFEEX), fill = FALSE))
# 
# Coefficients:
# (Intercept)       LIFEEX  
#  -2.442e-12   -3.330e+02

# Computing autocorrelation of residuals
r <- residuals(mod)
r <- pwcor(r, L(r, 1, substr(names(r), 1, 3)))  # Need this to compute a panel-lag
r
# [1] .98

# Running the regression again quasi-differencing the transformed data
modCO <- lm(PCGDP ~ LIFEEX, data = fdiff(fhdwithin(fselect(pwlddev, PCGDP, LIFEEX), variable.wise = FALSE), rho = r, stubs = FALSE))
modCO
# 
# Call:
# lm(formula = PCGDP ~ LIFEEX, data = fdiff(fhdwithin(fselect(pwlddev, 
#     PCGDP, LIFEEX), variable.wise = FALSE), rho = r, stubs = FALSE))
# 
# Coefficients:
# (Intercept)       LIFEEX  
#      -12.93       -91.97

# In this case rho is almost 1, so we might as well just difference the untransformed data and go with that
# We also need to bootstrap this for proper standard errors.
```

<!-- compared to `plm::lag` or `plm::diff`  -->
A final important advantage of the *collapse* functions is that the panel-identifiers are preserved, even if a matrix of lags / leads / differences or growth rates is returned. This allows for nested panel-computations, for example we can compute shifted sequences of lagged / leaded and iterated panel differences:


```r
# Sequence of differneces (same as above), adding one extra lag of the whole sequence
head(L(D(LIFEEX, -1:3, 1:2), 0:1))

All of this naturally generalized to computations on *pdata.frames*:

### 1.5 Panel Data to Array Conversions

Viewing and transforming panel data stored in an array can be a powerful strategy, especially as it provides much more direct access to the different dimensions of the data. The function `psmat` can be used to efficiently transform *pseries* to a 2D matrix, and *pdata.frame*'s to a 3D array:


```r
# Converting the panel series to array, individual rows (default)
str(psmat(LIFEEX))
#  'psmat' num [1:216, 1:61] 65.7 32.4 37.5 62.3 NA ...
#  - attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2
#   ..$ : chr [1:216] "ABW" "AFG" "AGO" "ALB" ...
#   ..$ : chr [1:61] "1960" "1961" "1962" "1963" ...
#  - attr(*, "transpose")= logi FALSE

# Converting the panel series to array, individual columns
str(psmat(LIFEEX, transpose = TRUE))
#  'psmat' num [1:61, 1:216] 65.7 66.1 66.4 66.8 67.1 ...
#  - attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2
#   ..$ : chr [1:61] "1960" "1961" "1962" "1963" ...
#   ..$ : chr [1:216] "ABW" "AFG" "AGO" "ALB" ...
#  - attr(*, "transpose")= logi TRUE

# Same as plm::as.matrix.pseries, apart from attributes
identical(unattrib(psmat(LIFEEX)),
          unattrib(as.matrix(LIFEEX)))
# [1] TRUE
identical(unattrib(psmat(LIFEEX, transpose = TRUE)),
          unattrib(as.matrix(LIFEEX, idbyrow = FALSE)))
# [1] TRUE
```

Applying `psmat` to a *pdata.frame* yields a 3D array:


```r
psar <- psmat(pwlddev, cols = 9:12)
str(psar)
#  'psmat' num [1:216, 1:61, 1:4] NA NA NA NA NA ...
#  - attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 3
#   ..$ : chr [1:216] "ABW" "AFG" "AGO" "ALB" ...
#   ..$ : chr [1:61] "1960" "1961" "1962" "1963" ...
#   ..$ : chr [1:4] "PCGDP" "LIFEEX" "GINI" "ODA"
#  - attr(*, "transpose")= logi FALSE

str(psmat(pwlddev, cols = 9:12, transpose = TRUE))
#  'psmat' num [1:61, 1:216, 1:4] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
#  - attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 3
#   ..$ : chr [1:61] "1960" "1961" "1962" "1963" ...
#   ..$ : chr [1:216] "ABW" "AFG" "AGO" "ALB" ...
#   ..$ : chr [1:4] "PCGDP" "LIFEEX" "GINI" "ODA"
#  - attr(*, "transpose")= logi TRUE
```

This format can be very convenient to quickly and freely access data for different countries, variables and time-periods:


```r
# Looking at wealth, health and inequality in Brazil and Argentinia, 1990-1999
aperm(psar[c("BRA","ARG"), as.character(1990:1999), c("PCGDP", "LIFEEX", "GINI")])
# , , BRA
# 
#          1990   1991   1992   1993   1994   1995   1996   1997   1998   1999
# PCGDP  7983.7 7963.1 7791.8 8020.6 8311.6 8540.1 8591.0 8744.8 8641.3 8554.1
# LIFEEX   66.3   66.7   67.1   67.5   67.9   68.3   68.7   69.1   69.4   69.8
# GINI     60.5     NA   53.2   60.1     NA   59.6   59.9   59.8   59.6   59.0
# 
# , , ARG
# 
#          1990   1991   1992   1993   1994   1995   1996   1997   1998   1999
# PCGDP  6245.7 6721.3 7157.3 7644.2 7988.6 7666.5 7994.2 8543.0 8772.1 8381.3
# LIFEEX   71.6   71.8   72.0   72.2   72.5   72.7   72.8   73.0   73.2   73.4
# GINI       NA   46.8   45.5   44.9   45.9   48.9   49.5   49.1   50.7   49.8
```

`psmat` can also return the output as a list of panel series matrices:


```r
pslist <- psmat(pwlddev, cols = 9:12, array = FALSE)
str(pslist)
# List of 4
#  $ PCGDP : 'psmat' num [1:216, 1:61] NA NA NA NA NA ...
#   ..- attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2
#   .. ..$ : chr [1:216] "ABW" "AFG" "AGO" "ALB" ...
#   .. ..$ : chr [1:61] "1960" "1961" "1962" "1963" ...
#   ..- attr(*, "transpose")= logi FALSE
#  $ LIFEEX: 'psmat' num [1:216, 1:61] 65.7 32.4 37.5 62.3 NA ...
#   ..- attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2
#   .. ..$ : chr [1:216] "ABW" "AFG" "AGO" "ALB" ...
#   .. ..$ : chr [1:61] "1960" "1961" "1962" "1963" ...
#   ..- attr(*, "transpose")= logi FALSE
#  $ GINI  : 'psmat' num [1:216, 1:61] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
#   ..- attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2
#   .. ..$ : chr [1:216] "ABW" "AFG" "AGO" "ALB" ...
#   .. ..$ : chr [1:61] "1960" "1961" "1962" "1963" ...
#   ..- attr(*, "transpose")= logi FALSE
#  $ ODA   : 'psmat' num [1:216, 1:61] NA 116769997 -390000 NA NA ...
#   ..- attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2
#   .. ..$ : chr [1:216] "ABW" "AFG" "AGO" "ALB" ...
#   .. ..$ : chr [1:61] "1960" "1961" "1962" "1963" ...
#   ..- attr(*, "transpose")= logi FALSE
```

This list can then be unlisted using the function `unlist2d` (for unlisting in 2-dimensions), to yield a reshaped data.frame:

```r
head(unlist2d(pslist, idcols = "Variable", row.names = "Country Code"), 3)
#   Variable Country Code 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969 1970 1971 1972 1973 1974

```

Of course we could also have applied some transformation (like computing pairwise correlations) to each matrix before unlisting. In any case this kind of programming provides lots of possibilities to explore and manipulate panel data (as we will see in Part 2).

### Benchmarks

Below benchmarks are provided of the *collapse* implementation against native *plm*. To do this the dataset used so far is extended to have approx 1 million observations:


```r
wlddevsmall <- get_vars(wlddev, c("iso3c","year","OECD","PCGDP","LIFEEX","GINI","ODA"))
wlddevsmall$iso3c <- as.character(wlddevsmall$iso3c)
data <- replicate(100, wlddevsmall, simplify = FALSE)
rm(wlddevsmall)
uniquify <- function(x, i) {
  x$iso3c <- paste0(x$iso3c, i)
  x
}
data <- unlist2d(Map(uniquify, data, as.list(1:100)), idcols = FALSE)
data <- pdata.frame(data, index = c("iso3c", "year"))
pdim(data)
# Balanced Panel: n = 21600, T = 61, N = 1317600
```

The data has 21600 individuals (countries) observed for up to 61 years (1960-2020), the total number of rows is 1317600. We can pull out a series of life expectancy and run some benchmarks. The Windows laptop on which these benchmarks were run has a 2x 2.2 GHZ Intel i5 processor, 8GB DDR3 RAM and a Samsung SSD hard drive.


```r

<!-- The results show that I did not promise too much in the introduction. A speed gain of 20-40x is the norm, and for certain operations such as the sequence of lags and leads the speed gain is about 100x, and for the panel series to matrix conversion a 300x speed gain by using *collapse* vs. native *plm*.  -->

The above dataset has 1 million obs in 20 thousand groups, but what about 10 million obs and 1 million groups? Do *collapse* functions scale efficiently as data and the number of groups grows large? Here is a simple benchmark:


```r
x <- rnorm(1e7)                                     # 10 million obs
g <- qF(rep(1:1e6, each = 10), na.exclude = FALSE)  # 1 million individuals
t <- qF(rep(1:10, 1e6), na.exclude = FALSE)         # 10 time-periods per individual

The results show that *collapse* functions perform very well even as the number of groups grows large.

<!-- in fact tests show that the large sample performance for aggregations with *collapse* is similar to *data.table*, and *collapse* grouped transformations like the ones shown here are generally faster than what can be done with *data.table*.  -->

The conclusion of this benchmark analysis is that *collapse*'s fast functions, with or without the help of *plm* classes, allow for very fast transformations of panel data, and should enable R programmers and econometricians to implement high-performance panel data estimators without having to dive into C/C++ themselves or resorting to *data.table* metaprogramming.

## Part 2: Fast Exploration of Panel Data

*collapse* also provides some essential functions to summarize and explore panel data, such as a fast check of variation over different dimensions, fast summary-statistics for panel data, panel-auto, partial-auto and cross-correlation functions, and a fast F-test to test fixed effects and other exclusion restrictions on (large) panel data models. Panel data to matrix conversion further allows the application of some correlational and unsupervised learning tools such as PCA, clustering or dynamic factor analysis.

### 2.1 Variation Check for Panel Data

The function `varying` can be used to check over which panel-dimensions different variable have variation. When passed a *pdata.frame*, `varying` by default takes the first identifier and checks for variation *within* that dimension.


```r
# This checks for any variation within "iso3c", the first index variable: TRUE means data vary within country i.e. over time.
varying(pwlddev)
# country    date    year  decade  region  income    OECD   PCGDP  LIFEEX    GINI     ODA     POP 
#   FALSE    TRUE    TRUE    TRUE   FALSE   FALSE   FALSE    TRUE    TRUE    TRUE    TRUE    TRUE
```
Alternatively any index variable or combination of index variables can be specified:


```r
# This checks any variation within time variable, i.e. cross-sectional variation.
varying(pwlddev, effect = "year")
# country   iso3c    date  decade  region  income    OECD   PCGDP  LIFEEX    GINI     ODA     POP 
#    TRUE    TRUE   FALSE   FALSE    TRUE    TRUE    TRUE    TRUE    TRUE    TRUE    TRUE    TRUE
```
Another possibility is checking for variation within each group:


```r
# This checks cross-sectional variation within each year for 4 indicators.
head(varying(pwlddev, effect = "year", cols = 9:12, any_group = FALSE))
#      PCGDP LIFEEX GINI  ODA
# 1960  TRUE   TRUE   NA TRUE
# 1961  TRUE   TRUE   NA TRUE
# 1962  TRUE   TRUE   NA TRUE
# 1963  TRUE   TRUE   NA TRUE
# 1964  TRUE   TRUE   NA TRUE
# 1965  TRUE   TRUE   NA TRUE
```

`varying` also has a pseries method. The code below checks for time-variation of the GINI index within each country. A `NA` is returned when there are no observations within a particular country.


```r
head(varying(pwlddev$GINI, any_group = FALSE), 20)
#  ABW  AFG  AGO  ALB  AND  ARE  ARG  ARM  ASM  ATG  AUS  AUT  AZE  BDI  BEL  BEN  BFA  BGD  BGR  BHR 
#   NA   NA TRUE TRUE   NA TRUE TRUE TRUE   NA   NA TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE   NA
```

If we would like to gave more information about this variation, we could also invoke the functions `fndistinct` and `fsd`, which do not have *pseries* methods:


```r
head(fndistinct(pwlddev$GINI, index(pwlddev, "iso3c")), 20)
# ABW AFG AGO ALB AND ARE ARG ARM ASM ATG AUS AUT AZE BDI BEL BEN BFA BGD BGR BHR 
#   0   0   3   9   0   2  29  20   0   0   9  16   5   4  16   3   5   9  12   0

head(round(fsd(pwlddev$GINI, index(pwlddev, "iso3c")), 2), 20)
#  ABW  AFG  AGO  ALB  AND  ARE  ARG  ARM  ASM  ATG  AUS  AUT  AZE  BDI  BEL  BEN  BFA  BGD  BGR  BHR 
#   NA   NA 5.18 2.47   NA 4.60 3.84 2.76   NA   NA 1.19 1.76 4.85 4.37 1.71 4.60 5.98 3.02 2.58   NA
```

### 2.2 Summary Statistics for Panel Data

Efficient summary statistics for panel data have long been implemented in other statistical softwares. The command `qsu`, shorthand for 'quick-summary', is a very efficient summary statistics command inspired by the *xtsummarize* command in the Stata statistical software. It computes a default set of 5 statistics (N, mean, sd, min and max) and can also computed higher moments (skewness and kurtosis) in a single pass through the data (using a numerically stable online algorithm generalized from Welford's Algorithm for variance computations). With panel data, `qsu` computes these statistics not just on the raw data, but also on the between-transformed and within-transformed data:


```r

# , , PCGDP

```

Key statistics to look at in this summary are the sample size and the standard-deviation decomposed into the between-individuals and the within-individuals standard-deviation: For GDP per Capita we have 8995 observations in the panel series for 203 countries, with on average 44.31 observations (time-periods T) per country. The between-country standard deviation is 19600 USD, around 3-times larger than the within-country (over-time) standard deviation of 6300 USD. Regarding the mean, the between-mean, computed as a cross-sectional average of country averages, usually differs slightly from the overall average taken across all data points. The within-transformed data is computed and summarized with the overall mean added back (i.e. as in `fwithin(PCGDP, mean = "overall.mean")`).

We can also do groupwise panel-statistics and `qsu` also supports weights (not shown):

Here it should be noted that any grouping is applied independently from the data-transformation, i.e. the data is first transformed, and then grouped statistics are calculated on the transformed data. The computation of statistics is very efficient:


```r
qsu(LIFEEX_l)
#               N/T     Mean       SD      Min      Max
# Overall  1'167000  64.2963  11.4759   18.907  85.4171
# Between     20700  64.9537     9.87  40.9663  85.4171
# Within    56.3768  64.2963   6.0839  32.9068  84.4198

microbenchmark(qsu(LIFEEX_l))
# Unit: milliseconds
#           expr     min       lq     mean   median       uq      max neval
#  qsu(LIFEEX_l) 9.49355 10.25679 11.07317 10.37214 10.78839 50.22574   100
```

Using the transformation functions and the functions `pwcor` and `pwcov`, we can also easily explore the correlation structure of the data:


```r
# Overall pairwise correlations with pairwise observation count and significance testing (* = significant at 5% level)
pwcor(get_vars(pwlddev, 9:12), N = TRUE, P = TRUE)
#               PCGDP        LIFEEX         GINI          ODA
# PCGDP    1   (9470)   .57* (9022) -.44* (1735) -.16* (7128)
# LIFEEX  .57* (9022)   1   (11670) -.35* (1742) -.02  (8142)
# GINI   -.44* (1735)  -.35* (1742)   1   (1744) -.20* (1109)
# ODA    -.16* (7128)  -.02  (8142) -.20* (1109)   1   (8608)

# Between correlations
pwcor(fmean(get_vars(pwlddev, 9:12), pwlddev$iso3c), N = TRUE, P = TRUE)
#              PCGDP      LIFEEX        GINI         ODA
# PCGDP    1   (206)  .60* (199) -.42* (165) -.25* (172)
# LIFEEX  .60* (199)   1   (207) -.40* (165) -.21* (172)
# GINI   -.42* (165) -.40* (165)   1   (167) -.19* (145)
# ODA    -.25* (172) -.21* (172) -.19* (145)   1   (178)

# Within correlations
pwcor(W(pwlddev, cols = 9:12, keep.ids = FALSE), N = TRUE, P = TRUE)
#               W.PCGDP      W.LIFEEX       W.GINI        W.ODA
# W.PCGDP    1   (9470)   .31* (9022) -.01  (1735) -.01  (7128)
# W.LIFEEX  .31* (9022)   1   (11670) -.16* (1742)  .17* (8142)
# W.GINI   -.01  (1735)  -.16* (1742)   1   (1744) -.08* (1109)
# W.ODA    -.01  (7128)   .17* (8142) -.08* (1109)   1   (8608)
```

The correlations show that the between (cross-country) relationships of these macro-variables are quite strong, but within countries the relationships are much weaker, for example there seems to be no significant relationship between GDP per Capita and either inequality or ODA received within countries over time.

### 2.3 Exploring Panel Data in Matrix / Array Form

We can take a single panel series such as GDP per Capita and explore it further:
<!-- The function `psmat` very efficiently generates a matrix from the series: -->
<!-- , fig.width=15 -->

```r
# Generating a (transposed) matrix of country GDPs per capita
tGDPmat <- psmat(PCGDP, transpose = TRUE)
tGDPmat[1:10, 1:10]
#      ABW AFG AGO ALB AND ARE  ARG ARM ASM ATG
# 1960  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA 5643  NA  NA  NA
# 1961  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA 5853  NA  NA  NA
# 1962  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA 5711  NA  NA  NA
# 1963  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA 5323  NA  NA  NA
# 1964  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA 5773  NA  NA  NA
# 1965  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA 6286  NA  NA  NA
# 1966  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA 6152  NA  NA  NA
# 1967  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA 6255  NA  NA  NA
# 1968  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA 6461  NA  NA  NA
# 1969  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA 6981  NA  NA  NA

# plot the matrix (it will plot correctly no matter how the matrix is transposed)
plot(tGDPmat, main = "GDP per Capita")
```

<div class="figure">
<img src="figure/PLMGDPmat-1.png" alt="plot of chunk PLMGDPmat" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">plot of chunk PLMGDPmat</p>
</div>

```r

# Taking series with more than 20 observation
suffsamp <- tGDPmat[, fnobs(tGDPmat) > 20]

# Minimum pairwise observations between any two series:
min(pwnobs(suffsamp))
# [1] 16

# We can use the pairwise-correlations of the annual growth rates to hierarchically cluster the economies:
plot(hclust(as.dist(1-pwcor(G(suffsamp)))))
```

<div class="figure">
<img src="figure/PLMGDPmat-2.png" alt="plot of chunk PLMGDPmat" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">plot of chunk PLMGDPmat</p>
</div>

```r

# Finally we could do PCA on the growth rates:
eig <- eigen(pwcor(G(suffsamp)))
plot(seq_col(suffsamp), eig$values/sum(eig$values)*100, xlab = "Number of Principal Components", ylab = "% Variance Explained", main = "Screeplot")
```

<div class="figure">
<img src="figure/PLMGDPmat-3.png" alt="plot of chunk PLMGDPmat" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">plot of chunk PLMGDPmat</p>
</div>

There is also a nice plot-method applied to panel series arrays returned when `psmat` is applied to a panel data.frame:


```r
plot(psmat(pwlddev, cols = 9:12), legend = TRUE)
```

<div class="figure">
<img src="figure/pwlddev_plot-1.png" alt="plot of chunk pwlddev_plot" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">plot of chunk pwlddev_plot</p>
</div>

<!-- Returning a list of panel series matrices allows efficient unlisting to data.frame, although of course there are other ways to reshape data in this way (i.e. `reshape2`, `tidyr`): -->

<!-- ```{r, eval = NCRAN} -->
<!-- # head(unlist2d(psmat(pwlddev, cols = 9:12, array = FALSE), idcols = "Variable", row.names = "Country Code")) -->
<!-- ``` -->

Above we have explored the cross-sectional relationship between the different national GDP series. Now we explore the time-dependence of the panel-vectors as a whole:

### 2.4 Panel- Auto-, Partial-Auto and Cross-Correlation Functions

The functions `psacf`, `pspacf` and `psccf` mimic `stats::acf`, `stats::pacf` and `stats::ccf` for panel-vectors and panel data.frames. Below we compute the panel series autocorrelation function of the data:


```r
psacf(pwlddev, cols = 9:12)
```

<div class="figure">
<img src="figure/plm_psacf-1.png" alt="plot of chunk plm_psacf" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">plot of chunk plm_psacf</p>
</div>

The computation is conducted by first scaling and centering (i.e. standardizing) the panel-vectors by groups (using `fscale`, default argument `gscale = TRUE`), and then taking the covariance of each series with a matrix of properly computed panel-lags of itself (using `flag`), and dividing that by the variance of the overall series (using `fvar`).

In a similar way we can compute the Partial-ACF (using a multivariate Yule-Walker decomposition on the ACF, as in `stats::pacf`),


```r
pspacf(pwlddev, cols = 9:12)
```

<div class="figure">
<img src="figure/plm_pspacf-1.png" alt="plot of chunk plm_pspacf" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">plot of chunk plm_pspacf</p>
</div>

and the panel-cross-correlation function between GDP per capita and life expectancy (which is already contained in the ACF plot above):


```r
psccf(PCGDP, LIFEEX)
```

<div class="figure">
<img src="figure/plm_psccf-1.png" alt="plot of chunk plm_psccf" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">plot of chunk plm_psccf</p>
</div>

### 2.5 Testing for Individual Specific and Time-Effects

As a final step of exploration, we could analyze our series and simple models for the significance and explanatory power of individual or time-fixed effects, without going all the way to running a Hausman Test of fixed vs. random effects on a fully specified model. The main function here is `fFtest` which efficiently computes a fast R-Squared based F-test of exclusion restrictions on models potentially involving many factors. By default (argument `full.df = TRUE`) the degrees of freedom of the test are adjusted to make it identical to the F-statistic from regressing the series on a set of country and time dummies^[In fact factors are projected out using `fixest::demean` and no regression is run at all].


```r
# Testing GDP per Capita
fFtest(PCGDP, index(PCGDP))    # Testing individual and time-fixed effects
#    R-Sq.      DF1      DF2  F-Stat.  P-value

#     0.924       265     11404   519.762     0.000
fFtest(LIFEEX, index(LIFEEX, 1)) # Testing individual effects
#     R-Sq.       DF1       DF2   F-Stat.   P-value 
#     0.719       215     11454   136.276     0.000
fFtest(LIFEEX, index(LIFEEX, 2)) # Testing time effects
#     R-Sq.       DF1       DF2   F-Stat.   P-value 
#     0.218        60     11609    54.075     0.000
```
Below we test the correlation between the country and time-means of GDP and Life-Expectancy:

```r

We can also test for the significance of individual and time-fixed effects (or both) in the regression of GDP on life expectancy and ODA received:


```r
fFtest(PCGDP, index(PCGDP), get_vars(pwlddev, c("LIFEEX","ODA")))    # Testing individual and time-fixed effects
#                     R-Sq.  DF1  DF2  F-Stat.  P-Value
# Full Model          0.915  227 6682  316.551    0.000
# Restricted Model    0.162    2 6907  668.816    0.000
# Exclusion Rest.     0.753  225 6682  262.732    0.000
fFtest(PCGDP, index(PCGDP, 2), get_vars(pwlddev, c("iso3c","LIFEEX","ODA")))    # Testing time-fixed effects
#                     R-Sq.  DF1  DF2  F-Stat.  P-Value
# Full Model          0.915  227 6682  316.551    0.000
# Restricted Model    0.909  168 6741  403.168    0.000
# Exclusion Rest.     0.005   59 6682    7.238    0.000
```

As can be expected in this cross-country data, individual and time-fixed effects play a large role in explaining the data, and these effects are correlated across series, suggesting that a fixed-effects model with both types of fixed-effects would be appropriate. To round things off, below we compute the Hausman test of Fixed vs. Random effects, which confirms this conclusion:


```r
phtest(PCGDP ~ LIFEEX, data = pwlddev)
# 
# 	Hausman Test
# 
# data:  PCGDP ~ LIFEEX
# chisq = 397.04, df = 1, p-value < 2.2e-16
# alternative hypothesis: one model is inconsistent
```

## Part 3: Programming Panel Data Estimators

A central goal of the *collapse* package is to facilitate advanced and fast programming with data. A primary field of application for the fast functions introduced above is to program efficient panel data estimators. In this section we walk through a short example of how this can be done. The application will be an implementation of the Hausman and Taylor (1981) estimator, considering a more general case than currently implemented in the *plm* package.

In Hausman and Taylor (1981), in a more general scenario, we have a linear panel-model of the form $$y_{it} = \beta_1X_{1it} + \beta_2X_{2it} + \beta_3Z_{1i} + \beta_4Z_{2i} + \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \epsilon$$ where $\alpha_i$ denotes unobserved individual specific effects and $\gamma_t$ denotes unobserved global events. This model has up to 4 kinds of covariates:

* Time-Varying covariates $X_{1it}$ that are uncorrelated with the individual specific effect $\alpha_i$, such that $E[X_{1it}\alpha_i] = 0$. It may be the case that $E[X_{1it}\gamma_t] \neq 0$

* Time-Varying covariates $X_{2it}$ with $E[X_{2it}\alpha_i] \neq 0$ and possibly $E[X_{2it}\gamma_t] \neq 0$

* Time-Invariant covariates $Z_{1i}$ with $E[Z_{1i}\alpha_i] = 0$

* Time-Invariant covariates $Z_{2i}$ with $E[Z_{2i}\alpha_i] \neq 0$

The main estimation problem arises from $E[Z_{2i}\alpha_i] \neq 0$, which would usually prevent us from estimating $\beta_4$ since taking a within-transformation (fixed effects) would remove $Z_{2i}$ from the equation. Hausman and Taylor (1981) stipulated that since $E[X_{1it}\alpha_i] = 0$, once could use $X_{1i.}$ i.e. the between-transformed $X_{1it}$ to instrument for $Z_{2i}$. They propose an IV/2SLS estimation of the whole equation where the within-transformed covariates $\tilde{X}_{1it}$ and $\tilde{X}_{2it}$ are used to instrument $X_{1it}$ and $X_{2it}$, and $X_{1i.}$ instruments $Z_{2i}$. Assuming that missing values have been removed beforehand, and also taking into account the possibility that $E[X_{1it}\gamma_t] \neq 0$ and $E[X_{2it}\gamma_t] \neq 0$ (i.e. accounting for time fixed-effects), this estimator can be coded as follows:


  <!-- # This function converts atomic vectors passed to named lists -->
  <!-- ln <- function(x, nam) if(!is.null(x) && is.atomic(x)) `names<-`(list(x), nam) else x  -->

  <!-- # Create instrument matrix: if time.FE, higher-order demean X1 and X2, else normal demeaning -->
  <!-- IVS <- do.call(cbind, c(ln(if(time.FE) fhdwithin(X1, na.rm = FALSE) else fwithin(X1, na.rm = FALSE), "W.X1"),  -->
  <!--             ln(fbetween(X1, na.rm = FALSE), "B.X1"), ln(Z1, "Z1"), -->
  <!--             ln(if(is.null(X2)) X2 else if(time.FE) fhdwithin(X2, na.rm = FALSE) else fwithin(X2, na.rm = FALSE), "W.X2"))) -->

  <!-- # Create matrix of independent variables -->
  <!-- X <- do.call(cbind, c(ln(X1, "X1"), ln(X2, "X2"), ln(Z1, "Z1"), ln(Z2, "Z2")))  -->



```r
HT_est <- function(y, X1, Z2, X2 = NULL, Z1 = NULL, time.FE = FALSE) {

  # Create matrix of independent variables
  X <- cbind(Intercept = 1, do.call(cbind, c(X1, X2, Z1, Z2)))

  # Create instrument matrix: if time.FE, higher-order demean X1 and X2, else normal demeaning
  IVS <- cbind(Intercept = 1, do.call(cbind,
               c(if(time.FE) fhdwithin(X1, na.rm = FALSE) else fwithin(X1, na.rm = FALSE),
                 if(is.null(X2)) X2 else if(time.FE) fhdwithin(X2, na.rm = FALSE) else fwithin(X2, na.rm = FALSE),
                 Z1, fbetween(X1, na.rm = FALSE))))

  if(length(IVS) == length(X)) { # The IV estimator case
    return(drop(solve(crossprod(IVS, X), crossprod(IVS, y))))
  } else { # The 2SLS case
    Xhat <- qr.fitted(qr(IVS), X)  # First stage
    return(drop(qr.coef(qr(Xhat), y)))   # Second stage
  }
}
```

The estimator is written in such a way that variables of the type $X_{2it}$ and $Z_{1i}$ are optional, and it also includes an option to also project out time-FE or not. The expected inputs for $X_{1it}$ (`X1`), and $X_{2it}$ (`X2`) are column-subsets of a *pdata.frame*.

Having coded the estimator, it would be good to have an example to run it on. I have tried to squeeze an example out of the `wlddev` data used so far in this vignette. It is quite crappy and suffers from a weak-IV problem, but for there sake of illustration lets do it:

We want to estimate the panel-regression of life-expectancy on GDP per Capita, ODA received, the GINI index and a time-invariant dummy indicating whether the country is an OECD member. All variables except the dummy enter in logs, so this is an elasticity regression.
<!-- dat <- fdroplevels(na_omit(get_vars(wlddev, c("iso3c","year","OECD","PCGDP","GINI","LIFEEX","ODA")))) -->
<!-- get_vars(dat, 4:7) <- log(get_vars(dat, 4:7)) -->
<!-- dat <- pdata.frame(dat, index = c("iso3c", "year")) -->
<!-- dat$OECD <- as.numeric(dat$OECD) # Creating OECD dummy -->
<
<!-- # This tests each oth the covariates is correlated with with alpha_i -->
<!-- phtest(ODA ~ PCGDP, dat) -->
<!-- phtest(ODA ~ LIFEEX, dat) -->
<!-- phtest(ODA ~ GINI, dat) -->
<!-- phtest(ODA ~ PCGDP + LIFEEX + GINI, dat) -->

<!-- # We expect ODA membershi -->
<!-- cor.test(dat$OECD, B(dat$ODA)) -->


<!-- fe <- fixef(plm(ODA ~ PCGDP + LIFEEX + GINI, dat)) -->

<!-- cor.test(fe, fmean(dat$OECD, index(dat, 1))) -->


```r
dat <- get_vars(wlddev, c("iso3c","year","OECD","PCGDP","LIFEEX","GINI","ODA"))
get_vars(dat, 4:7) <- lapply(get_vars(dat, 4:7), log) # Taking logs of the data
dat$OECD <- as.numeric(dat$OECD)                      # Creating OECD dummy
dat <- pdata.frame(fdroplevels(na_omit(dat)),         # Creating Panel data.frame, after removing missing values
                   index = c("iso3c", "year"))        # and dropping unused factor levels
pdim(dat)
# Unbalanced Panel: n = 134, T = 1-34, N = 1068
varying(dat)
#   year   OECD  PCGDP LIFEEX   GINI    ODA 
#   TRUE  FALSE   TRUE   TRUE   TRUE   TRUE
```

Using the GINI index cost a lot of observations and brought the sample size down to 918, but the GINI index will be a key variable in what follows. Clearly the OECD dummy is time-invariant. Below we run Hausman-tests of fixed vs. random effects to determine which covariates might be correlated with the unobserved individual effects, and which model would be most appropriate.


```r
# This tests whether each of the covariates is correlated with alpha_i
phtest(LIFEEX ~ PCGDP, dat)  # Likely correlated
# 
# 	Hausman Test
# 
# data:  LIFEEX ~ PCGDP
# chisq = 17.495, df = 1, p-value = 2.881e-05
# alternative hypothesis: one model is inconsistent
phtest(LIFEEX ~ ODA, dat)    # Likely correlated
# 
# 	Hausman Test
# 
# data:  LIFEEX ~ ODA
# chisq = 43.925, df = 1, p-value = 3.413e-11
# alternative hypothesis: one model is inconsistent
phtest(LIFEEX ~ GINI, dat)   # Likely not correlated !
# 
# 	Hausman Test
# 
# data:  LIFEEX ~ GINI
# chisq = 0.56851, df = 1, p-value = 0.4509
# alternative hypothesis: one model is inconsistent
phtest(LIFEEX ~ PCGDP + ODA + GINI, dat)  # Fixed Effects is the appropriate model for this regression
# 
# 	Hausman Test
# 
# data:  LIFEEX ~ PCGDP + ODA + GINI
# chisq = 24.198, df = 3, p-value = 2.272e-05
# alternative hypothesis: one model is inconsistent
```

The tests suggest that both GDP per Capita and ODA are correlated with country-specific unobservables affecting life-expectancy, and overall a fixed-effects model would be appropriate. However, the Hausman test on the GINI index fails to reject: Country specific unobservables affecting average life-expectancy are not necessarily correlated with the level of inequality across countries.

Now if we want to include the OECD dummy in the regression, we cannot use fixed-effects as this would wipe-out the dummy as well. If the dummy is uncorrelated with the country-specific unobservables affecting life-expectancy (the $\alpha_i$), then we could use a solution suggested by Mundlak (1978) and simply add between-transformed versions of PCGDP and ODA in the regression (in addition to PCGDP and ODA in levels), and so 'control' for the part of PCGDP and ODA correlated with the $\alpha_i$ (in the IV literature this is known as the control-function approach). If however the OECD dummy is correlated with the $\alpha_i$, then we need to use the Hausman and Taylor (1981) estimator. Below I suggest 2 methods of testing this correlation:


```r
# Testing the correlation between OECD dummy and the Between-transformed Life-Expectancy (i.e. not accounting for other covariates)
cor.test(dat$OECD, B(dat$LIFEEX)) # -> Significant correlation of 0.21
# 
# 	Pearson's product-moment correlation
# 
# data:  dat$OECD and B(dat$LIFEEX)
# t = 6.797, df = 1066, p-value = 1.774e-11
# alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0
# 95 percent confidence interval:
#  0.1456048 0.2606109
# sample estimates:
#       cor 
# 0.2038109

# Getting the fixed-effects (estimates of alpha_i) from the model (i.e. accounting for the other covariates)
fe <- fixef(plm(LIFEEX ~ PCGDP + ODA + GINI, dat, model = "within"))
mODA <- fmean(dat$ODA, dat$iso3c)
# Again testing the correlation
cor.test(fe, mODA[match(names(fe), names(mODA))]) # -> Not Significant.. but probably due to small sample size, the correlation is still 0.13
# 
# 	Pearson's product-moment correlation
# 
# data:  fe and mODA[match(names(fe), names(mODA))]
# t = 1.1218, df = 132, p-value = 0.264
# alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0
# 95 percent confidence interval:
#  -0.07362567  0.26243949
# sample estimates:
#        cor 
# 0.09717608
```

I interpret the test results as rejecting the hypothesis that the dummy is uncorrelated with $\alpha_i$, thus we do have a case for Hausman and Taylor (1981) here: the OECD dummy is a $Z_{2i}$ with $E[Z_{2i}\alpha_i]\neq 0$. The Hausman tests above suggested that the GINI index is the only variable uncorrelated with $\alpha_i$, thus GINI is $X_{1it}$ with $E[X_{1it}\alpha_i] = 0$. Finally PCGDP and ODA jointly constitute $X_{2it}$, where the Hausman tests strongly suggested that $E[X_{2it}\alpha_i] \neq 0$. We do not have a $Z_{1i}$ in this setup, i.e. a time-invariant variable uncorrelated with the $\alpha_i$.

The Hausman and Taylor (1981) estimator stipulates that we should instrument the OECD dummy with $X_{1i.}$, the between-transformed GINI index. Let us therefore test the regression of the dummy on this instrument to see of it would be a good (i.e. relevant) instrument:


```r
# This computes the regression of OECD on the GINI instrument: Weak IV problem !!
fFtest(dat$OECD, B(dat$GINI))
#    R-Sq.      DF1      DF2  F-Stat.  P-value 
#    0.000        1     1066    0.153    0.695
```

The 0 R-Squared and the F-Statistic of 0.21 suggest that the instrument is very weak indeed, rubbish to be precise, thus the implementation of the HT estimator below is also a rubbish example, but it is still good for illustration purposes:


```r
HT_est(y = dat$LIFEEX,
       X1 = get_vars(dat, "GINI"),
       Z2 = get_vars(dat, "OECD"),
       X2 = get_vars(dat, c("PCGDP","ODA")))
#    Intercept         GINI        PCGDP          ODA         OECD 
#  3.638486969 -0.035596160  0.120981946  0.005744747 -5.862368476
```

Now a central questions is of course: How computationally efficient is this estimator? Let us try to re-run it on the data generated for the benchmark in Part 1:


```r
dat <- get_vars(data, c("iso3c","year","OECD","PCGDP","LIFEEX","GINI","ODA"))
get_vars(dat, 4:7) <- lapply(get_vars(dat, 4:7), log) # Taking logs of the data
dat$OECD <- as.numeric(dat$OECD)                      # Creating OECD dummy
dat <- pdata.frame(fdroplevels(na_omit(dat)),         # Creating Panel data.frame, after removing missing values
                   index = c("iso3c", "year"))        # and dropping unused factor levels
pdim(dat)
# Unbalanced Panel: n = 13400, T = 1-34, N = 106800
varying(dat)
#   year   OECD  PCGDP LIFEEX   GINI    ODA 
#   TRUE  FALSE   TRUE   TRUE   TRUE   TRUE

library(microbenchmark)
microbenchmark(HT_est = HT_est(y = dat$LIFEEX,     # The estimator as before
                      X1 = get_vars(dat, "GINI"),
                      Z2 = get_vars(dat, "OECD"),
                      X2 = get_vars(dat, c("PCGDP","ODA"))),
              HT_est_TFE =  HT_est(y = dat$LIFEEX, # Also Projecting out Time-FE
                      X1 = get_vars(dat, "GINI"),
                      Z2 = get_vars(dat, "OECD"),
                      X2 = get_vars(dat, c("PCGDP","ODA")),
                      time.FE = TRUE))
# Unit: milliseconds
#        expr       min       lq      mean    median        uq      max neval
#      HT_est  7.919437  8.46937  9.761301  8.869612  9.508597 45.08717   100

```

At around 100,000 obs and 13,000 groups in an unbalanced panel, the computation involving 3 grouped centering and 1 grouped averaging task as well as 2 list-to matrix conversions and an IV-procedure took about 10 milliseconds with only individual effects, and about 40 - 45 milliseconds with individual and time-fixed effects (projected out iteratively). This should leave some room for running this on much larger data. <!--, and even for implementing a bootstrap standard error at this sample size. -->
